- Free up architects to focus on what they love (actual design work)
- Target: Architecture and design professionals

### Differentiation Points
1. **Listening & Customization**
   - Bespoke, customized solutions (not one-size-fits-all)
   - Deep listening and problem definition
   - Understanding their specific needs and workflows

2. **Reliability & Quality**
   - Rigorous academic background prevents "AI slop"
   - Consider every edge case and potential failure point
   - Security and reliability are vital

3. **Domain Expertise**
   - Specialized in architecture and design workflows
   - Understand the unique challenges of the field
   - Build tools that integrate seamlessly with existing processes

## Current Website
- Single page for Revit Door & Room Tagger tool
- Needs expansion to showcase broader consultancy services
- Maintain the successful calculator and demo elements

## Services & Portfolio Approach

### Services Offered
- Custom AI-driven automation solutions
- Workflow analysis and optimization
- AI integration & training
- "Anything that makes them say 'there's gotta be a better way to do this'"

### Pain Points to Address
- **Repetitive tasks** (like door tagging) - already solved
- **Business operations** - financials, billing, cost estimates
- **Solo architect challenges** - "everything from design, construction drawings, cost estimates, construction management of 2 crews and all the financial / billing"

### Future Project Ideas
- **Cost estimation automation** - Build tool that scrapes prices from Lowes/Home Depot for regional material costs
- Address the monopoly on material cost data
- Could be extremely valuable for architects and other construction professionals

### Portfolio Strategy
- Showcase tools and projects (similar to architecture firm portfolios)
- Emphasize AI-driven automations on main page
- Focus on demonstrating what's possible rather than technical specifics
- Current challenge: Only one tool so far (Revit Door & Room Tagger)

### IP & Customization Balance
- Build customized solutions with transferable robustness
- Consider selling IP developed during work
- Need to balance customization messaging with transferability
- Don't want to discredit sales by making work seem too custom
